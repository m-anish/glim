# Controls

glim is meant to be operable in the dark, by feel, by someone who has never seen
the code. One joystick, four gestures.

## The gestures

| Gesture | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Push up / down** | Ramp the *selected* channel brighter / dimmer. Push a little for fine control, push all the way for a fast sweep. |
| **Flick left / right** | Move to the previous / next channel (wraps around all 3). The channel you land on **blinks once** so you can see which light you're now controlling. |
| **Tap the stick (SW)** | Toggle **this** channel on / off. Turning it off remembers the level; turning a never-used channel on gives it a default brightness. |
| **Hold the stick (SW)** | Toggle **all** channels on / off. Anything lit → everything off ("goodnight"); nothing lit → everything back on at its remembered level. |

At power-on the selected channel blinks once, so you always know where you are.

**Maintenance gesture — factory reset:** power on with the button held. All three
channels swell up together as you keep holding; once they reach full and flash,
saved brightness/selection is wiped back to defaults. Let go before the flash to
cancel and boot normally.

## How it feels, and why

- **Two toggles, same shape.** Tap = this light, hold = all lights. Both are
  toggles, both remember levels — there's no "off" gesture that lacks an "on".
- **Proportional ramp.** Brightness speed follows how far you push the stick, so
  you get both fine trimming (nudge) and quick changes (full push) from one axis
  without menus or modes.
- **Slower where it matters.** The ramp eases down toward the bottom of the range
  (4× slower at 0 than at full), because picking a *dim* level needs finer
  control than picking a bright one. At full push that's ~20 levels/sec at the
  bottom and ~80/sec at the top; a full sweep takes ~6 s.
- **Perceptually linear.** Duty is gamma-corrected (square law), so the ramp
  looks even top-to-bottom instead of doing everything in the last 10%.
- **Edge-triggered selection.** A flick changes the channel *once*; you have to
  let the stick return most of the way to centre before it will change again. No
  runaway scrolling.
- **The blink is the display.** With no screen, the acknowledge-blink is how the
  device tells you which channel it thinks you mean. Only the selected channel
  blinks; the others hold steady.
- **The pixel is the other half.** A WS2812 by the joystick holds the selected
  channel's colour (amber / green / blue), so "which light am I steering?" is
  answerable at a glance, not just at the moment you flick. When every channel is
  off it fades to a dim glow — a locator in a dark room.
- **It remembers.** State is written to EEPROM a few seconds after you stop, and
  restored on boot — so a wall switch (or a power blip) brings the room back the
  way you left it, not black or blazing.
- **Nothing snaps.** On/off toggles, all-off, and the boot restore all *fade*
  over a couple hundred ms rather than jumping. The fade is fast enough that it
  never lags the live joystick ramp.
- **Smooth at the bottom.** The 8-bit PWM is temporally dithered (sigma-delta),
  buying extra effective resolution so deep dimming glides instead of
  stair-stepping through visible steps.

## Tuning

Everything lives in [`include/config.h`](../include/config.h). The knobs you're
most likely to touch:

| Setting | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `JOY_Y_INVERT`, `JOY_X_INVERT` | Flip an axis if up-is-dimmer or right-is-wrong on your build. Cheap joysticks vary in orientation — expect to set at least one of these. |
| `RAMP_FULL_MS` | Ramp speed at the top of the range. **Lower = snappier** — this is the first knob to touch if the ramp feels wrong. |
| `RAMP_LOW_FACTOR` | How much slower the ramp is when dim vs. bright (4 = 4× slower at the bottom). 1 gives a constant rate. |
| `JOY_DEADZONE` | How far you can wobble around centre before anything happens. Raise it if a channel drifts on its own. |
| `JOY_X_THRESH` / `JOY_X_REARM` | How hard you must flick to change channel, and how far back to centre before the next flick counts. |
| `DEFAULT_LEVEL` | Brightness a channel comes up at on first boot / first tap-on. |
| `PWM_MIN_DUTY` | The dimmest lit step. Raise it if low settings flicker or drop out on the PT4115. |
| `FADE_MS` | Fade time for on/off toggles and the boot restore. Lower = snappier. |
| `DITHER_BITS` | Extra dimming resolution (0 disables). Higher is smoother but the dither pattern slows — keep ≤3 at ~1 kHz PWM to stay flicker-free. |
| `SW_LONGPRESS_MS` | How long "hold" is before it means all-off. |
| `FACTORY_HOLD_MS` | How long the button must be held *at power-on* to wipe to defaults. |

### Calibration note

The stick's centre is measured automatically at power-on, so **leave the joystick
released while it boots**. If your resting readings drift, set `GLIM_DEBUG 1` in
`config.h`, reflash, and open `pio device monitor` (115200) to watch live X/Y
values while you find good deadzone/threshold numbers.
